# Download a file, using http, https, or ftp
#
# This is a wrapper for \code{\link{download.file}} and takes all the same
# arguments. The only difference is that, if the protocol is https, it changes
# some settings to make it work. How exactly the settings are changed
# differs among platforms.
#
# This function also should follow http redirects on all platforms, which is
# something that does not happen by default when \code{curl} is used, as on
# Mac OS X.
#
# With Windows, it calls \code{setInternet2}, which tells R to use the
# \code{internet2.dll}. Then it downloads the file by calling
# \code{\link{download.file}} using the \code{"internal"} method.
#
# On other platforms, it will try to use \code{wget}, then \code{curl}, and
# then \code{lynx} to download the file. Typically, Linux platforms will have
# \code{wget} installed, and Mac OS X will have \code{curl}.
#
# Note that for many (perhaps most) types of files, you will want to use
# \code{mode="wb"} so that the file is downloaded in binary mode.
#
# @param url The URL to download.
# @param ... Other arguments that are passed to \code{\link{download.file}}.
#
# @seealso \code{\link{download.file}} for more information on the arguments
#   that can be used with this function.
#
# @examples
# \dontrun{
# # Download the downloader source, in binary mode
# download("https://github.com/wch/downloader/zipball/master",
#          "downloader.zip", mode = "wb")
